Summary of the current state of the cocoa farms:
The available data does not provide direct information about the state of the cocoa farms. However, based on a total of 40 producers, high amount of messages, and number of uploaded images, it is indicative of active engagement amongst the farming community in seeking advice and sharing information. It hints at a possible digital literacy, which should be further encouraged to increase their tech-savviness and to enhance their ability to utilize such platforms more effectively for farm management. 

2. Key health issues that might be present:
Specific health issues in the crop cannot be directly inferred from the data. However, one of the messages mentions 'mirides', a pest that attacks cocoa. Mirids might be one of the key health issues currently causing damage to the crops if it's not managed properly.  

3. Recommendations for improving farm productivity:
a. Pest management: Given the mention of pests (mirides), it's advisable for the farmers to use recommended pesticides or consider natural pest control methods and strictly follow the instructions for usage to avoid harming the crop.
b. Training: Organizing more training or information sharing sessions could improve farmersâ€™ understanding of crop diseases, good agricultural practices, and how to effectively use digital platforms for managing their farms.
c. Co-operative farming: The mention of 'Cooperative: SCAES' implies some farmers may be part of a farming collective. Encouraging and forming such farmer collectives promotes shared learning, cost-sharing, and could increase bargaining power for selling the produce.

4. Estimated yield potential based on activity levels:
Again, the data given doesn't provide sufficient information to estimate yield potential. High engagement doesn't necessarily indicate high or low yield. For accurate predictions, more detailed information related to farm size, plant density, tree age, cultivation practices, and climate conditions are needed. However, we can say that the highly interactive farmers likely have the potential to improve productivity and quality of their cocoa by addressing inquiries, learning from shared information, and applying best practices on their farms."
